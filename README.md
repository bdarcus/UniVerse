### 2. Deep-Link Achievement Detail
Achievements aren't just icons. Every badge and artifact has a dedicated detail page showing the full story: the evidence provided, the faculty who verified it, and the specific skills it validates for your future career.

### 3. Integrated Assessement
Assessement is deeply-integrated from the beginning, for students and faculty alike.
